This page contains a list of handouts and links relevant to my research interests. Please note that the handouts listed here do not include I produced for [The Millennial Linguist](https://twitter.com/linguistatSEA), which can be found somewhere else. More importantly, these handouts are free and will be updated on occasion. All handouts are also posted in PDF, so make sure you have a PDF reader installed.
