Hello! This is the first official blog post for my new site. I used to have a Wordpress page with a similar name, but there were many things I couldn't do with it like changing the CSS settings and getting rid of the ads. 

Here are the things I hope to do with this site:
1. Share language insights. I've been studying linguistics and language education for nearly eight years. Recently, I've been working on a project that involves my interests (i.e., corpus linguistics, social semiotics, and language and the media). When I discover something juicy (read: controversial) or anything worth attention, I might say something about that here.

2. Teaching insights: I have a few years of teaching experience, so sometimes, I might have something to say about my experiences with my own students.

3. Graduate student life: Being in grad school is not easy. I would like to share pieces of advice that I picked up or learned from my experience, which I hope would be helpful to others. Just take them with a pinch of salt.

4. Other interests: Not many know this, but I'm interested in video games, art, anime, popular music, comics, and cosplay. I don't write reviews, but I will write my personal reactions and musings related to these things. I might also announce streaming schedules of me playing a video game, where you will be linked to my Twitch account. 

There's probably more I might write about, but I'm pretty sure I will be saying some things about these four things. Hahaha. 


For now, I'll be revamping and updating the other pages. In the meantime, check out my [Twitter][twitter] and [Instagram][insta] pages. See you! :D
