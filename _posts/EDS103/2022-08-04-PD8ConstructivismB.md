*This post is part of my blog project "[Pedagogy Discourses](https://www.pedagogydiscs.wordpress.com) (PDs)," which is a course requirement at the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU).*

In my *Principles of Teaching* course, we were tasked to accomplish the [Teaching Perspectives Inventory](http://www.teachingperspectives.com/tpi/) and assess our own results. This inventory provided us a series of questions, each of which points to beliefs, intentions, and actions that are particular teaching perspective. In addition, the inventory is believed to be useful in constructing our own philosophy of teaching. These perspectives are as follows:

**(a) Transmission:** Educators who hold this perspective prioritize content or subject matter mastery as the goal of the teaching-learning process. Those who hold this view apply different strategies grounded on cognitive information processing such as setting clear objectives, providing reviews, and finding the appropriate pacing for lectures.

**(b) Apprenticeship:** In this perspective, educators emphasize teaching through authentic tasks within their learners' zone of development, so they become independent learners. Based on this perspective, their role is a *highly skilled professional* that works similar to Vygotsky's *More Knowledgeable Other*. 

**(c) Developmental:** When educators take this perspective, they serve as builders that bridge learners towards more sophisticated and critical thinking by using questioning strategies and tasks that relate new to old knowledge. In many ways, this perspective could reflect Piaget's cognitive constructivism.

**(d) Nurturing:** Educators espousing this view of teaching promotes learning as a result of learners' becoming motivated and exerting much effort to analyze problems within a highly supportive environment. This perspective's emphasis on promoting a climate that "comes from the heart" and accepts failure as part of learning reminds us of social learning theories (specifically, when importance was given to the role of the learning environment on learners and vice versa).

**(e) Social Reform:** Educators who adopt this lens view highlight the political nature of the teaching-learning process. The website explains that the learning process is one where learners "take critical stances to give power to take social action to improve their own lives and the lives of others." This view is promoted by the likes of Paulo Freire (2005)[^1], who argued that education has to center on the needs of the masses and building a better society by addressing inequality. 

Based on the inventory. my dominant perspectives were *Social Reform* and *Developmental*, whereas *Apprenticeship* was my recessive perspective. To be sure, I believe that each of these perspectives are important in their own right. I know that at some points in my teaching stints, I had adapted each of these views. However, my beliefs, pedagogical intentions, and practices indicate that I generally prioritize some perspectives over others. 

### How Constructivist, then?

Based on my TPI results and my own teaching, I would like to think that I am

How constructivist am I?
How can I become a better constructivist?  (Should I bother to try?)
How may I influence education practice to shift towards constructivist ideology and practice? (Should I?)
