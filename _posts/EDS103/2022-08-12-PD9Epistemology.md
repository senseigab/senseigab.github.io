*This post is part of my blog project "[Pedagogy Discourses](https://www.pedagogydiscs.wordpress.com) (PDs)," which is a course requirement at the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU).*

This week's lesson on epistemology is unexpectedly provocative. It forced me to take a step back and consider the main epistemological question underpinning my language learning and teaching beliefs: How do I know that my learners are learning language? 





Based on the readings for this topic, how would you characterize your epistemological 
beliefs? How have these beliefs been facilitating or inhibiting to the ways you learn? 
(Note that your response to the question may vary, depending on the academic discipline 
you refer to. In other words, you may hold a different set of epistemological beliefs in 
science and math as compared to your beliefs in history and social sciences.
