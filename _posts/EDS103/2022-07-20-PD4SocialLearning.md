*This post is part of my blog project "[Pedagogy Discourses](https://www.pedagogydiscs.wordpress.com) (PDs)," which is a course requirement at the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU).*

My first graduate school experience was generally a rollercoaster experience. This is because graduate students generally juggle their work, studies, and family responsibilities in the limited time available during the week. In fact, I remember that when I first taught college general education courses in English, I was assigned to manage an overloaded 11 classes while taking two graduate courses. These graduate classes, as with any other, required us to go beyond our comfort zones and pursue more complex research undertakings as part of the class requirements. We were also required to read as many as 10 research articles before the next meeting and had to do independent reading on top of that. While the requirements were reasonable, one important feeling that I had to always contend with was the feeling of incompetence and not being good enough despite my peers saying otherwise. If I am not mistaken, this phenomenon is called the *impostor syndrome.* 

But I had classmates who helped me overcome my impostor syndrome (and they know who they are). 






What factors facilitated some behaviors that you (or a significant other person, say in your family) has essentially acquired through observation?
