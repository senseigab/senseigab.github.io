The Third Communication Conference: Exploring the Realm of Communication is scheduled on August 4-5, 2017 at the Henry Sy Sr. Hall, De La Salle University. 

I will be speaking in a parallel session there titled "Language, Gender, and Discourses: Things People Should Know." In this talk, I will discuss the role of language and linguistics in analyzing discourses surrounding gender and sexuality. I will further outline the research trajectory and the current research trends, as well as the implications of many studies in media policies and practices.
