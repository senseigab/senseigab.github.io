Hello! You can call me Gab. I'm presently an MA Candidate in English Language Studies at the University of Santo Tomas. I have facilitated general education courses in English and communication with the College of Education, Colegio de San Juan de Letran (as an Instructor) and the Institute of Arts and Sciences, Far Eastern University (as a Lecturer). I have also delivered seminars and workshops on topics such as action research in education, research ethics, discourse and gender, and world Englishes, where my audiences include researchers, professionals, and senior high school students. 

Before graduate school, I received my B.A. in English Language Studies (*cum laude*) from the same university in 2015. During my college years, I served in different capacities (i.e., Outreach Committee Deputy Head, a member of the Board of Representatives, and Vice President for External Affairs) of the UST English Language Studies Society from 2013 to 2015.

Gab is currently one of the [National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)](https://nanowrimo.org) municipal liaisons for the Asia::Philippinnes region. I am also a lifetime member of the [Linguistic Society of the Philippines](https://lsphil.net). Furthermore, he runs [The Millennial Linguist](https://twitter.com/linguistatSEA) (@linguistatSEA) on Twitter. I also tweet[@senseigab](https://twitter.com/senseigab).
