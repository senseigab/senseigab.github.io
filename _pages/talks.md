### Widening Participation and Outreach
I have given talks on action research, research ethics, discourse and gender, and World Englishes to a variety of students. I am also able to discuss other issues about journalism, (English) language teaching, social justice, and other matters that might be in my interests or expertise. If you want me to speak on a specific issue, let me know.

**"The Languages/Linguistics Degree: The (Worth of a) Scholarly Path," Lourdes School of Mandaluyong City [online]. April 7, 2021.**

Thi was a career seminar delivered to Senior High School students at my previous school, Lourdes School of Mandaluyong. I gave students a flavor of what languages and linguistics are about, what careers they can obtain with a degree in languages and linguistics, and how it is like to be a knowledge worker in the academic industry. You can find my slides [here](https://senseigab.github.io/files/presentations/00_talks/2021_Gapas_LSMC.pdf). 

**"Applying Corpus-Assisted Multimodal Discourse Analysis: A Discursive News Values Study of an Armed Conflict," The Graduate School, University of Santo Tomas, Manila [online]. September 12, 2020.**

I presented my thesis, but focusing on theoretical and methodological issues, to Dr. Alejandro S. Bernardo's graduate Discourse Analysis class.

**"Appreciating Language Realities through Philippine English," Bulacan Agricultural State College, San Ildefonso, Bulacan. August 28, 2019.**

This was a seminar where I introduced the idea of language variation in the English language. To do so, I focused on Philippine English and described how it is distinct from other Englishes. This seminar was designed to encourage students to be involved in linguistic activism - that is, when they hear people say something harmful about language and their speakers, they would be able to challenge it using some of the information they learned in this seminar. Slides are available [here](https://senseigab.github.io/files/presentations/00_talks/2019_BASC_Gapas.pdf).

**"Introducing World Englishes: One Language, Multiple Identities, Multiple Realities," Senior High School, Far Eastern University, Manila. September 7, 2018.**

The flow and objectives of this seminar was somewhat similar to what I presented later on at the Bulacan Agricultural State College. This was presented to a linguistics club of senior high school students.

**"Language, Gender, and Discourses: Things People Should Know" (Parallel Session), The 3rd Communication Conference: Exploring the Realm of Communication, De La Salle University, Manila. August 4, 2017.**

I was invited to speak about language, discourse, and gender topics in the 3rd Communication Conference at DLSU Manila. My presentation offered a review of how gender is viewed and represented in the linguistics literature and offered insights and new methodologies (e.g., corpus linguistics) for researching gender in communication. In fact, one of my main arguments during this parallel session is that researchers in both communication and linguistics must be open to learning and applying various methods to answer gender-related questions in media discourses.

**"Publication and Research Ethics," Far Eastern University, Manila. March 14, 2017.**

This was an 90-minute lecture delivered to the FEU English Language Circle, where I discussed various issues relating to linguistics research ethics such as informed consent, levels of privacy, copyright, data management, and methodological transparency. A substantial part of the lecture was devoted to students brainstorming how to deal with particular research situations where ethical questions are involved (e.g., what to do when collecting data on social media).

**"Action Research" (co-facilitated with Mr. Danny O. Balance), University of Santo Tomas, Manila. (October 29, 2015.**

This seminar was delivered to a group of elementary school teachers in Manila. My role in this seminar was to introduce how action research is distinct from academic research and some action research management strategies that they could use.
