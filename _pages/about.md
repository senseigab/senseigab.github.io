</div>

I finished both my BA (cum laude; 2015) and MA (2020) degrees in English Language Studies at the [University of Santo Tomas, Manila](https://www.ust.edu.ph). My most recent master's research investigated how major Philippine broadsheets constructed the 2017 Marawi City crisis as a newsworthy happening in both written texts and news images, using corpus-assisted multimodal discourse analysis. This research was supervised by supervised by [Dr. Rachelle B. Lintao](https://www.ust.edu.ph/profile/lintao-rachelle-b/).

I have taught various language courses in higher education and have delivered seminars on a range of issues to various audiences. Moreover, I am a lifetime member of the [Linguistic Society of the Philippines](https://lsphil.net) and am currently pursuing a knowledge dissemination project called [The Community Linguist](https://twitter.com/tclinguistics) (@tclinguistics) on Twitter and its other platforms. In addition, I have sat in numerous undergraduate thesis committees in the BA English Language Studies program at UST, where I usually evaluate sociolinguistics and (critical) discourse analysis papers. 

### Areas of Interest

My current interests are spread in different areas of linguistics, especially sociolinguistics, (critical) discourse analysis, systemic functional linguistics, and applied linguistics. Here are some of my research interests in these areas:

* *Sociolinguistics:* language policy and politics, linguistic landscapes,(critical and multimodal) discourse analysis, corpus-based methods, media discourses
* *Language education:* (instructed) second language acquisition, social justice in language education
* *Forensic linguistics:* deception and aggression, courtroom discourse, statutory interpretation

I am also interested in higher education research, Asian popular cultures, science communication, decolonization efforts, and social justice research methodologies.

### Outside Academia

Beyond academia, I am currently one of the [National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)](https://nanowrimo.org) Municipal Liaisons for the Philippines. In addition, I have participated as a judge in the Filipino Reader's Choice Awards in 2013 for the Essay Anthology category and in 2014 for the Inspirational or Religious category. 

During my undergraduate years, I served in different official positions (i.e., as Outreach Committee Deputy Head, Board of Representatives member, and Vice President for External Affairs) at the [UST English Language Studies Society](https://www.facebook.com/USTELSSOC).

I'm also deeply interested in Korean and Japanese pop music, video games, and comics. More importantly, I truly adore cats and dogs. Here's our dog, Soling, from my hometown in Bohol! :D
