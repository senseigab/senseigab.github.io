### Hello!

My name's Wilfred Gabriel A. Gapas - Gab for short - and my preferred English pronouns are he/him/his or they/them/their. I am a language educator, applied linguistics researcher, and a freelance editor. My master's and bachelor's degrees were both earned at the [University of Santo Tomas, Manila](https://www.ust.edu.ph). I'm also a member of the Linguistic Society of the Philippines and the Cognitive Science Society.

As an educator, my experience has been in teaching English and communication courses in higher education institutions. My teaching stints have been complemented by seminars delivered to audiences such as public school teachers and high school students. Moreover, I have examined undergraduate theses on discourse analysis and sociolinguistics. 

Meanwhile, my research interests are broadly situated under sociolinguistics, discourse studies, language (teacher) education, and forensic linguistics. Some of my specific areas of interest include:
* language aggression;
* the language of healthcare and healthcare institutions;
* the discourses of public policy surrounding disasters and education;
* the multimodal construction and representation of knowledge and identity in the media (e.g., video games, news, etc.);
* (instructed) second language acquisition; and
* the promotion of plurilingual awareness in education systems.

I am also interested in higher education research, Asian popular cultures, science communication, decoloniality, and social justice research methodologies.

Beyond academia, I'm currently one of the [National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)](https://nanowrimo.org) Municipal Liaisons for the Philippines. In addition, I have taken part as a judge in the Filipino Reader's Choice Awards for the Essay Anthology category (2013) and the Inspirational or Religious category (2014). 

As an undergraduate, I served in different official positions within the [UST English Language Studies Society](https://www.facebook.com/USTELSSOC) as Deputy Head of the Outreach Committee (2013-2014), as Deputy Speaker and Member of the Board of Representatives (2013-2014), and as Vice President for External Affairs (2014-2015).

I'm also deeply interested in Korean and Japanese pop music, video games, and comics. More importantly, I truly adore cats and dogs. Here's our dog, Soling, from my hometown in Bohol! :D
