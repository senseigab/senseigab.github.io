Hello there!

I finished both my BA (cum laude; 2015) and MA (2020) degrees in English Language Studies at the [University of Santo Tomas, Manila](https://www.ust.edu.ph). My most recent master's research investigated how major Philippine broadsheets constructed the 2017 Marawi City crisis as a newsworthy happening in both written texts and news images, using the [Discursive News Values Analysis](https://newsvaluesanalysis.com) framework. In that same research, I also successfully implemented a combination of multiple methods called corpus-assisted multimodal discourse analysis. This research was supervised by supervised by [Professor Rachelle Ballesteros-Lintao](https://www.ust.edu.ph/profile/lintao-rachelle-b/).

As an educator and applied linguistics researcher, I have taught various language courses in higher education and have delivered seminars on a range of issues to various audiences. Moreover, I am a lifetime member of the [Linguistic Society of the Philippines](https://lsphil.net) and am currently pursuing a knowledge dissemination project called [The Community Linguist](https://twitter.com/tclinguistics) (@tchlinguistics) on Twitter and its other platforms. In addition, I have sat in a number of undergraduate thesis committees in the BA English Language Studies program at UST, where I usually evaluate (critical) discourse analysis papers. 

During my undergraduate years, I served in different official positions (i.e., as Outreach Committee Deputy Head, Board of Representatives member, and Vice President for External Affairs) at the [UST English Language Studies Society](https://www.facebook.com/USTELSSOC).

Beyond academia, I am currently one of the [National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)](https://nanowrimo.org) Municipal Liaisons for the Philippines. In addition, I have proudly taken part as a judge in the Filipino Reader's Choice Awards in 2013 (Essay Anthology category) and 2014 (Inspirational/Religious category).
