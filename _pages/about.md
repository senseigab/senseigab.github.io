Hello! I am an MA candidate in English Language Studies at the [University of Santo Tomas, Manila](https://www.ust.edu.ph). My master's research involved analyzing how major Philippine broadsheets constructed the 2017 Marawi City crisis as a newsworthy event, using Monika Bednarek and Helen Caple's *Discursive News Values Analysis*. My work also tested further a combination of multiple methods called corpus-assisted multimodal discourse analysis. I was supervised by [Professor Rachelle B. Lintao](https://ust.edu.ph/profile/lintao-rachelle-b/). I am also currently one of the [National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)](https://nanowrimo.org) Municipal Liaisons for the Philippines and the person behind [The Community Linguist](https://twitter.com/tclinguistics) (@tclinguistics) on Twitter and its other platforms. In addition, I am a lifetime member of the [Linguistic Society of the Philippines](https://lsphil.net).

I earned my BA in English Language Studies (*cum laude*) from the same university in 2015. As an undergraduate, I served in different official capacities (i.e., as Outreach Committee Deputy Head, Board of Representatives member, and Vice President for External Affairs) at the [UST English Language Studies Society](https://www.facebook.com/USTELSSOC).
