### About Gurong Politikal

**Gurong Politikal** - "Political Teacher" in English - is my political Youtube channel, where I offer commentary on various current sociopolitical issues in the Philippines and perhaps even beyond. It is named in that way, because everything around us is political. As a teacher, I recognize that I make political decisions every day. In varying degrees, these affect not just students, but also my co-teachers, families, and even other stakeholders. For example, you might want to ask me these questions: Why did you become an English teacher? Why and how do you check student outputs? Do you allow your students to negotiate with you about your classroom policies? Do you trust your students that they submit original work in class? What can you say about your local languages? 

All of those questions appear unrelated to politics at first, but they actually are political!

For instance, if I said that I became an English teacher because it is a profitable business, am I saying that teaching other languages cannot bring wealth and prosperity? Am I teaching the "language of imperialists" who conquered the Philippines? Am I in it "just for the money?" 

And that, my friends, is where politics creeps in. 

### "So, are you partisan?"

In some ways, yes, but being partisan is not the same as being political, even if they are related. Being political is much broader: I see it as a **struggle** over meaning.

Being partisan means becoming connected with a person or group in electoral politics. We can be non-partisan but political, but you *cannot* be apolitical but partisan.
