I am available to provide research assistance to undergraduate and graduate students in the humanities and the social sciences in general, with particular specialisms in applied linguistics and education. While I tend to employ qualitative paradigms, I advocate mixed-methods approaches while abandoning the qualitative-quantitative binary, because all kinds of research have varying degrees of each end of the research spectrum. 

* **Proposal Writing:** You can receive *assistance* as you prepare your research proposal. In particular, I can help you in (a) formulating research objectives, (b) presenting a compelling background for your research, (c) deciding on the strengths and weaknesses of your methods, (d) clarifying your theoretical and conceptual frameworks, (e) ensuring your methods adequately and ethically address your research objectives, and (f) ensuring the soundness of the style and structure of your work. This assistance occurs by (a) providing substantial commentary on your current proposal and recommending edits and (b) at least two online meetings through Zoom or Google Meet. 

Please note that my assistance **is not equivalent to ghost writing** your work and that it **may still change depending on the feedback of your committee or panel of examiners.** My consultation fees for this service depend on the complexity of the research project itself. However, the minimum fee is PhP 1,250.00, which applies in most cases to undergraduate students. A discount can be given for researchers from disadvantaged backgrounds and with disabilities.
